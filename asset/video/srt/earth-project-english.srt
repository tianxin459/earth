Hey there! Today we're introducing "Global Sourcing Purchase Order Dashboard". 

Which is an interactive 3D globe application designed to present the company's weekly Purchase Order data in a visually striking and intuitive manner, with the goal of being deployed on large screens in the company's lobbies.

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It uses Three.js to build a realistic 3D Earth model, visually displaying global purchase order distribution density through color heatmaps.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Based on D3.js geographic path algorithms, the project accurately displays the global procurement logistics network. Different colors represent orders in different cost ranges.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Interactive data labels are built with React components, displaying weekly purchase order quantity, average cost, and fluctuation trends in real time.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The data dashboard integrates Redux for state management, and supports multi-dimensional analysis and visual display of procurement costs.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The project implements SWR-based caching strategy combined with a timeline component for quick retrieval of historical procurement data, supporting cost trend comparison analysis.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Adopting pure React for full responsive design, it seamlessly adapts from mobile to large screens. The control panel can intelligently collapse to improve space utilization.

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The entire project is built on the React framework, using Webpack for modular development and GitHub Actions for CI/CD automated deployment. Thank you for watching!
